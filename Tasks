- Remove the column "Unnamed:0"
- get the categorical column names
- get the numerical columns
- Replace the missing values in numerical columns with their mean
- Draw the histogram of any one numerical column
    - Place the title of the graph as "Histogram"
    - On each bin print the count in that bin in the graph
- Draw the boxplot of any one column
- Create a subplot of (2,2).
    -(2,2,1) is a histogram
    -(2,2,2) is a boxplot
- Create a Subplot caluculate the no of graphs required based on number of numerical columns.
    - No of rows in the subplot equal to no of numerical columns
    - The plot should contains two graphs in each row. 
        - First is histogram and 
        - the second one is boxplot
    - Use figure size in plt.figure for proper graph size.
- Create Barplot for a categorical column
    - use the legend
    - xlabel
    - ylabel
- Create a subplot for categorical column barplots
